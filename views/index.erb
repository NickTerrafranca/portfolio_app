    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>I have been a technology enthusiast my entire life. From a young age I had two primary passions in life: Technology and Culinary Art. Partly due to the culture of my family and environment, I decided to pursue a career as a chef. During my career I was very successful, I held the position of Executive Chef at a number of highly regarded Boston establishments. During this time I was invited to cook at the prestigious <a href="http://www.jamesbeard.org " target="_blank">James Beard</a> House in NYC and was voted by my peers as one of Boston's <a href="http://stuffboston.com/2007/11/16/worth-their-salt-local-veteran-chefs-choose-their-favorite-young-guns#.U6TCXRbyDwI" target="_blank">“Top 5 Up and Coming Chefs”</a> by Boston’s Stuff Magazine. What I loved about the culinary arts is the need to continue learning and improving one’s skills. Being a chef required me to be both artistically creative and and strategically analytical. There are many drawbacks to working as a chef however, so about a year and a half ago I decided to start teaching myself web development. I fell in love, quit my job and enrolled in a local Ruby on Rails boot-camp called <a href="http://www.launchacademy.com/program" target="_blank">Launch Academy</a>. If you like, you can read my blog about <a href="http://nterrafranca.tumblr.com" target="_blank">my experience at Launch Academy</a></p>

    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <p><a href="">nterrafranca.com</a><br> The site you are looking at now is a simple Sinatra application built with very little framework "magic". I wanted to get back to the nitty-gritty and write good old fashioned Ruby, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. With a touch of jQuery, a little help from PostgreSql and a lightweight email Gem called Pony, this app to continue growing my front-end design chops and iteratively develop new features and content.<a href=""> View Code</a></p>

    <p><a href="http://uberchef.herokuapp.com" target="_blank"> UberChef</a><br>This MVP stage Rail application allows the user to connect with professional chefs for any number of culinary endeavors. After the user posts an event, chefs can then browse, search for and bid on events of their choice. The app also features a user-to-user messaging feature to facilitate direct communication for detailed bid negotiation. This app was prototyped while attending Launch Academy and continues to be a sandbox for new ideas and features.<a href="https://github.com/NickTerrafranca/uberchef" target="_blank"> View Code</a></p>

    <p><a href="http://fizzbuzzapp.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">FizzBuzz</a><br>This is a beer brewery review site worked while attending Launch Academy. As part of a small development team, I worked on the user authentication, schema design, Admin name-spacing and front-end design. This Ruby on Rail application made use of a brewery data API and gems like Devise, CarrierWave, ActionMailer and Bootstrap. The development of this app was fully test driven.<a href="https://github.com/LaunchAcademy/fizz_buzz" target="_blank"> View Code</a></p>
